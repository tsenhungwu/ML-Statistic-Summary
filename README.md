# ML + DL + Statistic + Random Number Generators 

Here is the summary of what I have learned so far by myself.

I recorded all the techniques, concepts, and knowledge as jupyter notebook files (Python programming languages). 

Four main topics covered (will be covered in this repository) are Machine-Learning, Deep-Learning, Statistic, and Random Number Generators.

If you have found any useful material and concept from my repository, don't remember to hit "Star" because this is the incentive for me to keep improving and uploading files.   

Or, if you would like to contribute any comment or opinion on it, I'm very welcome to share with you!

Stay tuned as there are more interesting concepts / techniques / tools coming up!
