# ML_Statistic_Summary

This is the summary of what I have learned so far by myself.

Four main topics covered (will be covered in this repository) are Statistic, Random Number Generators, Machine-Learning, and Deep-Learning. 

If you have found any useful material and concept from my repository, don't remember to hit "Star" because this is the incentive for me to keep improving.   

Or, if you would like to contribute any comment or opinion on it, I'm very welcome to share with you!

Stay tuned as there are more interesting concepts / techniques / tools coming up!
